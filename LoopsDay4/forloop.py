#Example 1:  print 1...10
#   range(1,11)

# for i in range(1,11):
#     print(i)


#Example 2: print even numbers between 1...10
#  range(2,11,2)

#method 1:
# for i in range(2,11,2):
#     print(i)

#method 2:
# for i in range(1,11):
#     if i%2==0:
#         print(i)
#

# Example 3:   10.....1
#  range(10,0,-1)

# for i in range(10,0,-1):
#     print(i)


#Example 4: variable scope in Python
# In Python, loop variables are accessible after the loop ends

# for i in range(1,6):
#     print(i)
#
# print(i)


#Example 5:

# for i in range(1,6):
#     pass
#
# print(i)  # 5

for i in range (0,10):
    print(i)


#  for loop on a list
# fruits = ["apple", "banana"]
# for fruit in fruits:
#     print(fruit)

# to get index along with value
# names = ["Alice", "Bob"]
# for index, name in enumerate(names):
#     print(f"{index}: {name}")
